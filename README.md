# Bangla-Handwriting-Character-Corpus
Welcome to our project repository for developing and evaluating a multi-class corpus for Bangla handwriting recognition. We aim to advance handwriting recognition by creating a robust dataset, applying preprocessing and augmentation techniques, and evaluating recognition algorithms to achieve high accuracy and efficiency.

# Description
This diverse dataset compiles the user's perspectives for their research purposes. If the researchers want to modify their work on this platform (NLP, machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence) using this dataset with the numerical vector, then it needs users' perspectives for their research purposes to identify the Unicode values, and if another section wants to use this dataset as the image that is already here. That's why we make access to this repository totally free for all further development. The productive way to use this dataset depends on the researchers or the users because of the diversity of this data, which can be used or modified however they need. We also notably understand that the availability that is demanded on the online platform is crucial. That's why this dataset contains all of the Bengali characters that exist or combine.

# Unique Feature
The dataset we have provided has a lot of unique features. The most efficient feature is Unicode values. Researchers can use this value instead of importing or modifying the image files but they first need to make understand the machine about the file that belongs to the value. This dataset contains every type of Benglai characters with their Unicode value as if combined characters or numerical characters. Another key feature is some characters that are used for sign language also have the Unicode values.

# Statistical Analysis
This expanded dataset now includes 25,900 additional samples, achieving a balanced representation across various demographics. This diversity is pivotal in developing more generalized and robust handwriting recognition models that perform well across different handwriting styles, thus enhancing the applicability of the research to a broader user base.

# Comparison with Existing Bangla Handwriting Datasets
In this section, we compare our developed dataset with prominent existing Bangla handwriting datasets to underscore the unique contributions and comprehensiveness of our work. The comparison focuses on sample size, demographic diversity, character coverage, and data accessibility. Our dataset significantly surpasses the size of other publicly available Bangla handwriting datasets. comparison of sample sizes:

- BanglaLekha-Isolated: 19,000 samples
- CMATERdb: 9,000 samples
- BN-HiLab: 12,000 samples
- Proposed Dataset: 25,900 samples
